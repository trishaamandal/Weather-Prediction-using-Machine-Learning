# Weather Prediction using Machine Learning (Python)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
### This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast maximum temperatures using historical weather data. It utilizes pandas for data handling, Ridge regression for predictive modeling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
### The dataset is sourced from "local_weather.csv".
### It contains weather attributes such as precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum temperature (temp_max), and minimum temperature (temp_min).
## ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
### Handling Missing Data: Computes the percentage of missing values.
### Column Optimization: Removes largely empty columns (snow & snow_depth).
### Missing Value Imputation: Fills missing values in precipitation, temp_max, and temp_min with their respective averages.
## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Trend Analysis: Visualizes temperature variations over time.
### Insights Extraction: Identifies seasonal patterns affecting temperature fluctuations.
## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model: Ridge Regression
### Predictors: Uses temp_max, temp_min, and precipitation as features.
### Target Variable: Predicts next-day temp_max using a shifted dataset approach.

## ðŸ“‹ Predictions & Analysis Table
### Actual vs Predicted Comparison: Analyzes model performance on test data.
### Predictions Generator Function: Automates model training, prediction, and evaluation.
## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
### Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs) for improved time-series forecasting.
### Connect with real-time weather APIs for live predictions.
### Explore ensemble learning to enhance prediction accuracy.
## ðŸ“œ Conclusion
### This project serves as a practical example of weather prediction using machine learning, covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It lays the groundwork for more advanced climate forecasting systems using AI.
